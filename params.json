{"name":"JasonVM","tagline":"Jason programming language executor","body":"### JasonVM\r\nJasonVM is a virtual machine used to execute Jason code.\r\nAn example Hello world application in Jason would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//HelloWorld.jason\r\n{\r\n    \"HelloWorld\": new function(String...args)\r\n    {\r\n        System.console.Write(\"Hello World!\"),\r\n        return 0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere is no need to compile it, as it is compiled by a JIT compiler.\r\n\r\nThe Jason programming language is based on the Javascript Object Notation (and that's how it got its name \"Jason\"), and extends it by adding programming functionality and more data types. The language was built to simplify GUI creation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContributor #JUAN: @Bobby-Z\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNah","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
